# Php 7 Framework
A PHP framework completely written in PHP 7

#Why another framework
I just wanted to develop my own framework from scratch. All the existing PHP Frameworks are heavy in size and performance footprint. Because they are designed to support backward compatibilities. But when anyone wants to start a new project with only Php 7 in mind he has no option to carry on those backward compatibilities code with any frameworks. That's why I am creating this framework. It will not support PHP 5, will only focused with PHP 7.
